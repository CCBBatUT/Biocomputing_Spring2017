### Today

- About this course
- Getting oriented to the linux server


#### Course goal

- Make programming a practical tool for you 

#### Why programming?

- A program is a series of tasks for a computer
- We're learning python, one of the more popular languages
- Why Python?
	- general concepts are almost universal
	- readable
	- popular
	- well-documented

#### So many benefits
- Programming is a tool to help you in your life

- Repeatability
	- a script can be a record of what happened
	- this is important when things go wrong
- Automation/Efficiency
	- do the same things many times
        - avoid time spent doing repetitive manual tasks
        - Almost anything on the computer that you do repeatedly and manually can be replaced by helpful programs 
- Many tasks in today's biology require it (ex. sequence data, plotting, data analysis)


#### Why Linux?
- We'll be using a Linux server for this course
- This is essentially a file system that you connect to and navigate using text commands
- <strong>Windows</strong> users should download PuTTY.exe from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">here</a>.
- You can only run many programs through the linux command line
- Linux makes performing operations on multiple files easier than doing by hand
       - Ex. renaming and moving files, running programs, replacing text. 
- You need to be able to navigate around in linux to use TACC

<br>
A note on backups: *Everyone should back up their computer regularly*. We will discuss some commands
today that can remove files, or even your entire file system if you are not careful.
	
### The server File system
- The computer contains a nested hierarchy of directories
- **directory** is a *folder* on your computer which contains files
- keeping track of where you are in the file structure of your computer is an important component of computing
- highest level is the **root** (denoted: `/`)
- forward slashes divide levels in the nested hierarchy of directories, e.g. `/top_level_directory/second_level_directory`
- there are several high-level directories that users don't usually go into where program files are stored
	- /usr/bin
	- /usr/lib
- every file on your computer has an address; if you are going to do an operation on a file, you need its address
- **path**: the *address* to a directory or file on your computer. There are, generally, two types of paths:
	- **absolute/full path** represents the path of a given directory or file beginning at the root directory
    - **relative path** represents the path of a given directory/file relative to the working/current directory
- for example, say you have a file "my\_favorite\_file.txt" located in the directory `/stor/Biocomputing2017/files`.
	- the **full path** to this file  is `/stor/Biocomputing/files/my_favorite_file.txt`
    - the **relative path** to this file depends on where you are on the computer
        - if you're currently in the Biocompution2017 folder, the relative path would be `files/my_favorite_file.txt` 
    
*Whenever you call the full path, you can reach the file from anywhere on your computer. Relative paths will change based on your current location.*


### Let's try out some commands

Command | Translation | Examples
--------|-------------|---------
`cd` | **c**hange **d**irectory | `cd /absolute/path/of/the/directory/` <br> Go to the home directory by typing simply  `cd` or `cd ~` <br> Go up (back) a directory by typing `cd ..`
`pwd` | **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory | `pwd`
`mkdir` | **m**ake **dir**ectory | `mkdir newDirectory` creates newDirectory in your current directory <br> Make a directory one level up with `mkdir ../newDirectory`
`cp` | **c**o<b>p</b>y | `cp file.txt newfile.txt` (and file.txt will still exist!)
`mv` | **m**o<b>v</b>e | `mv file.txt newfile.txt` (but file.txt will *no longer* exist!)
`rm` | **r**e<b>m</b>ove | `rm file.txt` removes file.txt <br> `rm -r directoryname/` removes the directory and all files within
`ls` | **l**i<b>s</b>t | `ls *.txt` lists all .txt files in current directory <br> `ls -a` lists all files including hidden ones in the current directory <br> `ls -l` lists all files in current directory including file sizes and timestamps <br> `ls -lh` does the same but changes file size format to be **h**uman-readable <br> `ls ../` lists files in the directory above the current one
`man` | **man**ual | `man ls` opens the manual for command `ls` (use `q` to escape page)
`grep` | **g**lobal **r**egular <br> **e**xpression **p**arser |  `grep ">" seqs.fasta` pulls out all sequence names in a fasta file <br> `grep -c ">" seqs.fasta` counts the number of those sequences <br> 
`cat` | con<b>cat</b>enate | `cat seqs.fasta` prints the contents of seqs.fasta to the screen (ie stdout)
`head` | **head** | `head seqs.fasta` prints the first 10 lines of the file <br> `head -n 3 seqs.fasta` prints first 3 lines
`tail` | **tail** | `tail seqs.fasta` prints the last 10 lines of the file <br> `tail -n 3 seqs.fasta` prints last 3 lines
`wc` | **w**ord **c**ount | `wc filename.txt` shows the number of new lines, number of words, and number of characters <br> `wc -l filename.txt` shows only the number of new lines <br> `wc -c filename.txt` shows only the number of characters
`sort` | **sort** | `sort filename.txt` sorts file and prints output
`uniq` | **uniq**ue | `uniq -u filename.txt` shows only unique elements of a list <br> (must use sort command first to cluster repeats)

<br>
<br>


### Demonstration/Excercises
- On PC, open a Putty Window 
          - fill in gsafcomp2.ccbb.utexas.edu and click 'connect'?
          - enter your username and password (most likely your TACC credentials)
- On Mac, open a terminal window
          - On the command line type: ssh [yourusername]@gsafcomp1.ccbb.utexas.edu 
          - Hit enter, and enter your password at the prompt.
          - If if asks about saving an RSA key, type 'yes'






### Handy dandy shortcuts

Shortcut | Use|
----------|-----|
Ctrl + C | kills current process
Ctrl + L <br> (or `clear`) | clears screen
Ctrl + A | Go to the beginning of the line
Ctrl + E | Go to the end of the line
Ctrl + U | Clears the line before the cursor position
Ctrl + K | Clear the line after the cursor
`*` | wildcard character
tab | completes word
Up Arrow | call last command
`.` | current directory
`..` | one level up 
`~` | home
`>` | redirects stdout to a file, *overwriting* file if it already exists
`>>` | redirects stdout to a file, *appending* to the end of file if it already exists
pipe (<code>&#124;</code>) | redirects stdout to become stdin for next command

<br>

### Homework

1. using commands and arguments
	- Find a partner to do the assignment. Spend 15 minutes using the commands on the cheat sheet 
with a directory on your computer. Be sure to try different arguments and use both files and directories.
	- Look up at least one command and read about all of its options. Share with your partner.
	- Create a directory called “My Directory”. What happened?
3. redirecting output
	- Create a new file containing your bash history.
	- How many times did you use the command `ls`?
	- Be sure to use these three symbols: <code>&#124;</code>, >, >>
